In this [thesis][gFun-thesis] we redesign funnelling by generalizing this procedure; we call the resulting framework Generalized Funnelling (gFun). In doing so, we enable gFun's meta-classifier to capitalize on different language-independent views of the document, that go beyond the document-class correlations captured by the posterior probabilities that are used in ``standard'' funnelling.

![gFun-architecture]{: .center-image }

To exemplify such views, we experiment with embeddings derived from word-word correlations (for this we use MUSE embedding) and embeddings derived from word-class correlations (for this we use WCE embeddings ) aligned across languages.
The extensive empirical evaluation we have carried out seems indeed to confirm the hypothesis that multiple, language-independent views that capture different types of correlations are beneficial for MLTC.
